# cook-book

Wow! You are already about to start your 2nd project. Amazing isn’t it? ✌️ The project of Module 2 is all about cooking. Yeah, you heard right! But your ingredients won’t be 🥔 potatoes, 🥕 carrots, or 🧅onions – you will be brewing a “cookbook” with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


In this project you will use the following tech stack:

-HTML5
-CSS3
-Styling Framework/Library (Bootstrap*, Bulma, Foundation)
*In the next exercise of this course you will learn more about Bootstrap.

Project Overview

-Create a static list of recipes
-A recipe must be composed of: Title, Description, Image, Table with ingredients
-Example
-Level 1 – Basic HTML & CSS structures
-A basic list of recipes
-Each list of recipes must have:
-Title: Must visually stand out
-Description – Not as important as title, still needs enhancements
-Image
-Table with ingredients


Level 2 – Styling Framework / Library

Enhance the style with a library and/or framework
Add responsive dimensions on table cells and image
Level 3 – CSS Hover animations
When the user hovers the recipe image with the mouse, the recipe title must be displayed on top of it
Level 4 – Vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation (just a pinch!)
Add a “Share” button underneath the recipe
When the user clicks on it, an alert with window (JavaScript alert) pops up with the URL of the page


Happy coding! ✌️
